\title{Interleaves values within matrices or vectors}
\usage{
Riffle(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{The objects or values that need to be interleaved.}
}
\value{
A vector or a matrix depending on the input. If one or more input
objects is a matrix, the result will also be a matrix.
}
\description{
Mimics some of the behavior of the \code{Riffle} function
(\url{http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Riffle.html}) in
Mathematica. For matrices, it interleaves the columns. For vectors, it
interleaves differently according to whether the subsequent values are
presented as separate values or whether they are grouped with \code{c()}.
}
\details{
It is expected that all matrices to be interleaved would have the same
number of rows, though they may have differing numbers of columns. If they
have differing numbers of columns, they are all made to conform to the same
dimension before proceeding by recycling the existing columns.
}
\examples{
m1 <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
m2 <- matrix(letters[1:9], nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

Riffle(m1, m2)
Riffle(m1, "||", m2)

m3 <- matrix(LETTERS[1:6], nrow = 3, ncol = 2)

Riffle(m1, m2, m3)

## Just vectors

Riffle(1:6, "x")
Riffle(1:6, "x", "y")
Riffle(1:6, c("x", "y"))
