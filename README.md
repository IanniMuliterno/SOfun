Functions I've written as answers to R questions on Stack Overflow. Destined to be the most important R package you have ever loaded in your R session. Filled with a very strongly cohesive set of functions, as indicated below:

1. `adjCombos`
1. `almostComplete`
1. `appendMe`
1. `clc`
1. `completeVecs`
1. `concat.split.DT`
1. `Diag`
1. `expandRows`
1. `Factor`
1. `findFirst`
1. `ftable2df`
1. `getMyRows`
1. `helpExtract`
1. `letterRep`
1. `makemeNA`
1. `melt.wide`
1. `moveMe`
1. `naLast`
1. `needleInHaystack`
1. `read.mtable`
1. `Riffle`
1. `SampleToSum`
1. `shifter`
1. `shuffler`
1. `tidyHTML`
1. `toColClasses`
1. `TriIndex`
1. `TrueSeq`
1. `vec2symmat`
1. `write.Hmisc.SPSS`

Don't ask me why I did this.
