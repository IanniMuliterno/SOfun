Authors@R: c(person("Ananda", "Mahto", email = "ananda@mahto.info",
             role = c("aut", "cre")),
             person("Jota", role = "aut"),
             person("Ed", "Morton", role = "aut"))
Description: Nothing special. A very incohesive collection of functions, that's
    all. If a function gets moved into a different package, it would be removed
    from here and struck out on the README file.
